###A phan page

#####This app is a very simple homage to the humble black bean. The design will be very clean and have a mobil centric design.

This app will incorporate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and will pull external data from a recipe website, most likely, Edamam (alternate Food2Fork), as per project requirements. I also hope to have a section of "learn more" where people can search for cookbooks on legume-centric and vegetarian cuisine, in a second API from google books, time permitting.

The opening page/screen will have a cartoon bean based on the artwork of Lisa Kirlew's cute food art designs (, I would like to style the bean so that it jams back and forth between two postions, postion a and position b, which will skew off of position a by appoximately 22 degrees clockwise. The main image of a cartoon bean will have a cartoon syle pow/bang bubble behind it. There will be some mention of the purpose of the app in small letters at the bottom, somtething to the effect of *"Unassuming workhorse of the vegetarian diet, the humble bean is a kernel of truth in a sea of over-promising, johnny-come-lately fad foods".*

After being prompted to click the bean the user will be whisked away to a magical page where there are search options for Legume-centric/ vegetarian recipies with pictures.  I hope to incorporate some cool CSS stylings in the buttons to selcet recipies, a wheel or slide bar perhaps.  I look forward to building on my CSS skills with this project, as well as solidifying the async/await function and axios call to an API.
