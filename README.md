### A phan page

##### This app is a very simple homage to the humble black bean. The design will be very clean and have a mobil centric design.

This app will incorporate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and will pull external data from the Edamam API, allowing the user to search for vegetarian recipes featuring black beans. 

The opening page/screen will have a cartoon bean based on the artwork of Lisa Kirlew's cute food art designs and will incorporate simple animations so that it jams back and forth between two postions, postion a and position b. The image of a cartoon bean on the main page will have a cartoon syle pow/bang bubble behind it. There will be some mention of why black beans are so awesome at the bottom of that first page, something to the effect of *"Unassuming workhorse of the vegetarian diet, the humble bean is a kernel of truth in a sea of over-promising, johnny-come-lately fad foods". Otherwise the fist page will be very simle with a lot of negatvie space.

After clicking the bean the user will be whisked away to a magical page featuring one random Legume-centric/ vegetarian recipe with a picture and the option to switch to view another random recipe.
